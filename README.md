As a November 2019 graduate of Makers Academy - I'm now pursuing a career in software development. I bring the skills I've developed in setting up and running a successful business into a technical environment.

I've been fortunate to work with and manage teams of people from diverse backgrounds, giving me the experience and adaptability to make the most of the opportunity that provides. Whilst in these roles, my interest grew in providing technical solutions to problems I faced on a day-to-day basis, which has lead me to a pursuit of a career in writing software.

## PROJECTS
| Project       | Summary       | Technologies  |
| ------------- |---------------| --------------|
| 1. TakeAway Challenge ([Github](https://github.com/mackacavs/takeaway-challenge/)) | One of my first completed coding projects at Makers - a fully tested app allowing you to order your favourite Takeaway food! | Ruby, RSpec, Twilio |
| 2. Acebook ([Github](https://github.com/mackacavs/acebook-agil/))|A Facebook Clone built whose backend is wrapped in an API and can be accessed with two front-ends - one built in [Rails](https://github.com/mackacavs/acebook-agil/) and the other [React](https://github.com/mackacavs/acebook-react-agil/) | Ruby On Rails, Rspec, Capybara, Javascript, React, Heroku, Redux |
| 3. bestB4 ([Github](https://github.com/eashworth/BestB4))| A full-stack appliction built with MERN where you can swap details in order to swap your expiring food, search for recipes based on local ingredients and hunt down those ingredients using Google Maps | Mongo, Express, React, Node, Spoonacular API, Google Maps API, Cypress, Jest |

## HOW I WORK WITH COMPUTERS

#### Building Scalable Code
I've found one of the most satisfying experiences when writing code is building something that's scalable. By focussing on regular refactors after passing tests I've managed to build applications that can grow with ease - without the need for painful and time-consuming deep-dives into already written code. During the last 2 weeks of the course I built [bestB4](https://github.com/eashworth/BestB4) with 5 of my fellow Makers. I made the decision at the start of our project to use Redux to manage our state - allowing us to easily expand the application later by creating components that could call external API's with data held in our Redux state. 

#### Following Agile Practices
Makers strongly encourage you to follow agile practices. We consistently worked on the basis of two-day sprints - giving the opportunity to reflect on the code we'd created and move forward based on what we *do* know rather that becoming bogged down in how our app will look several iterations down the line. When I spent two weeks in a group of four creating a [Facebook](https://github.com/mackacavs/acebook-agil/) clone, we used these two-day sprints to help us  build and grow the application's minimun viable product efficiently. We also used retrospectives at the end of every day to focus on immediate goals moving forward and stand-ups to make sure good processes were being followed.

#### Using TDD
I have to admit I was a late convert to TDD. All my coding experiences prior to Makers were based on building the appliction as quickly and inefficiently as possible - leaving countless lines of poor code in my wake. Over the last twelve weeks I've focussed on building applications following good TDD process-

* My [Airport](https://github.com/mackacavs/airport_challenge) project was my first introduction to Rspec
* This [Bowling Game Kata](https://github.com/mackacavs/bowling-challenge) used Jasmine as the test framework as the appliction was written in Javascript 
* [Chitter](https://github.com/mackacavs/chitter-challenge) is a good example of a fully tested application. Capybara for feature testing and Rspec for unit testing

## HOW I WORK WITH PEOPLE

#### Leadership
During my last role at Raft Furniture, I was promoted to assistant manager of our newly-created flagship store in Westfield Shepherd's Bush. I lead a team from many different nationalities and backgrounds with the responsibilities of keeping morale high, dealing with any conflicts as and when they would arise and delegating roles to members of staff who were working under me.

During my final project I had to show leadership as I was the only member of my team who knew the basics of both React and Redux. I encouraged my team throughout that we could achieve our project goals in a language of which we knew very little. We were really proud of what we did, particularly as we used this then-foreign tech stack and completed several stretch goals including using the [Spoonacular](https://github.com/eashworth/bestB4-Front-End/blob/master/src/actions/recipe.js) and [Google Maps API](https://github.com/eashworth/bestB4-Front-End/blob/master/src/actions/googleMap.js). 

#### The Ability To Be Empathetic
One of the primary skills I've developed throughout my career is the ability to understand others' concerns and address them in a suitable manner. This was developed through working with clients - where it's imperative you understand the wants and needs of your potential customer - and more generally with my colleagues. My ability to succeed in my last role - in a high-pressure sales environment - was defined by the relationships I built with people and I'll bring that into any tech-focussed role moving forward.

When I established my own company teaching English as a Foriegn Language to business clients in London, empathy was my most important and used skill. I primarily worked with clients on a one-to-one level and thus devloped close relationships and regularly experienced first-hand my students' struggles with learning a new language. I consistenly encouraged throughout - giving them the belief to achieve their desired language learning goals. 

#### Teamwork

I've consistently worked in teams during my Makers experience and most of my career. At Makers we had 3 team projects - my teams consisted of different characters and personalites. During [Acebook](https://github.com/mackacavs/acebook-agil/) I was paired with members of my cohort who came with over 40 years of development experience between them. We created a fantastic team spirit where I was happy to use their invaluble experience as I needed and happy to take over where I had more knowledge.

In my previous role in order to create the best possible customer experience and generate sales for the business, I had to work as part of a seamless team. Teams would consist of anything between 2 and 6 people and our success was dependent on functioning as a unit. We regularly had team meetings in the morning and check-ins with each other to make sure we working optimally.
