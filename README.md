After a series of experiences learning everything I can about people - through teaching, sales and travel - my journey has begun to learn everything I can about computers! 

I'm fascintated by buidling projects to help to make life simpler, working with diverse groups of people to help me learn more about myself and delving deep into documentation to help me fully understand the languages I'm learning.
