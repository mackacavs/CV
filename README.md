As a November 2019 graduate of Makers Academy - I'm now pursuing a career in software development, bringing the people skills I've developed in teaching and sales roles into a technical environment.

I've been fortunate to work with and manage teams of people from diverse backgrounds, giving me the experience and adaptability to make the most of the opportunity that provides. Whilst in these roles, my interest grew in providing technical solutions to problems I faced on a day-to-day basis, which has lead me to a pursuit of a career in writing software.

## PROJECTS
| Project       | Summary       | Technologies  |
| ------------- |---------------| --------------|
| 1. TakeAway Challenge ([Github](https://github.com/mackacavs/takeaway-challenge/)) | One of my first completed coding projects at Makers - a fully tested app allowing you to order your favourite Takeaway food! | Ruby, RSpec, Twilio |
| 2. Acebook ([Github](https://github.com/mackacavs/acebook-agil/))|A Facebook Clone built whose backend is wrapped in an API and can be accessed with two front-ends - one built in [Rails](https://github.com/mackacavs/acebook-agil/) and the other [React](https://github.com/mackacavs/acebook-react-agil/) | Ruby On Rails, Rspec, Capybara, Javascript, React, Heroku, Redux |
| 3. bestB4 ([Github](Github Link))| A full-stack appliction built with MERN where you can swap details in order to swap your expiring food, search for recipes based on local ingredients and hunt down those ingredients using Google Maps | Mongo, Express, React, Node, Spoonacular API, Google Maps API, Cypress, Jest |

## HOW I WORK WITH COMPUTERS

#### Building Scalable Code
I've found one of the most satisfying experiences when writing code is building something that's scalable. By focussing on regular refactors after passing tests I've managed to build applications that can grow comfortably. A good example is [bestB4](Github Link), where I made the decision at the start of our project to use Redux to manage our state - allowing us to later create components that could easily call external API's with data in our Redux state.

#### Following Agile Practices
Makers is fantastic at encouraging you to follow agile practices. We consistently worked on the basis of two-day sprints - giving the opportunity to reflect on the code we'd created and move forward based on what we do know rather that what we don't. During our two weeks creating an [Acebook](https://github.com/mackacavs/acebook-agil/) clone, we had continuous two-day sprints to help us to continue to build and grow the application's minimun viable product efficiently.

#### Using TDD
I have to admit I was a late convert to TDD. All my coding experiences prior to Makers were based on building the appliction as quickly and inefficiently as possible - leaving countless lines of poor code in my wake. Over the last twelve weeks I've focussed on building applications using TDD. 

My [Airport](https://github.com/mackacavs/airport_challenge) project was my first introduction to Rspec, for this [Bowling Game Kata](https://github.com/mackacavs/bowling-challenge) I used Jasmine as the appliction was written in Javascript and [Chitter](https://github.com/mackacavs/chitter-challenge) is a good example of Capybara - which I used to fully test my front-end.

## HOW I WORK WITH PEOPLE

#### Leadership
During my last role at Raft Furniture I lead a team from many different nationalities and backgrounds. As in any workplace I regularly dealt with conflicts both between members of staff themselves as well as members of staff and the public. I consistently diffused these situations through a mix of understanding and good humour.

#### Relating To Others
One of the primary skills I developed throughout my career was the ability to understand others' concerns and address them in a suitable manner. This was developed through working with clients - where it's imperative you understand the wants and needs of your potential customer - and more generally with my colleagues. My ability to succeed in my last role - in a high-pressure sales environment - was defined by the relationships I built with people and I'll bring that into any tech-focussed role moving forward.

#### Empathy
When I taught English as a Foriegn Language empathy was my most important and used skill. I primarily worked with students on a one-to-one level and thus devloped close relationships and regularly experienced first-hand my students' struggles with learning a new language. I consistenly encouraged my students throughout my relationship with them giving them the belief to achieve their desired language learning goals.
